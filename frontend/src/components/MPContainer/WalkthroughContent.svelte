    Welcome to the Immersive Audio tool! The IA tool is an app designed to
    simplify the creation of immersive audio in the IAMF (.iamf) format.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin, add a source audio element. Once at least one audio element has
    been created, a mix presentation can be created. A mix presentation groups
    several audio sources and specifies their mixed playback format.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can have multiple mix presentations in the same IAMF file. Audio
    elements may also be used between multiple mix presentations â€” that's the
    cool part of the IAMF format.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a mix presentation created, you can playback the mix presentation and
    tweak it until it's just right. When all mixes are ready, click the export
    button, name your file, and the IAMF encoder will deliver the final IAMF
    file.
